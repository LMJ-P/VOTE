# VOTE

The VOTE project (Visualization of Austrian Parliamentary Elections) aims to create a web-based platform that visualizes Austrian National Council elections from 1945 to the present, with a specific focus on the rise of populism in political discourse since the 1990s. By combining historical election data with detailed analyses of political party platforms, the project provides insights into the themes that influenced electoral outcomes and shaped political discourse over time. This interdisciplinary effort, in partnership with the Centre for Digital Humanities (University of Graz), the Department of History (University of Graz), and the Department of Political Science (University of Vienna), integrates digital humanities tools, historical analysis, and political science perspectives to contextualize key trends in Austrian electoral history.Through the developed platform, users can explore visualizations of voter turnout, party evolution, and the presence of populist themes in election manifestos. A comprehensive database will also support future research by archiving election data and providing tools to analyze changes in political narratives. Ultimately, the project will offer reusable, high-quality data resources and visualizations that make Austrian political history more accessible and engaging.
